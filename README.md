# alt:vRP

[alt:V](https://altv.mp/) RP framework inspired by [ImagicTheCat/vRP](https://github.com/ImagicTheCat/vRP).

Currently under development.

Technologies being used: TypeScript, Babel, Webpack, Next.js, React and Node.js.

I really don't recommend using this at the current state, there are no configuration files or documentation.

## Installation

1. Download the project
2. Unzip the files on the folder `altvrp` inside your server `resources` folder
3. Add the resource `altvrp` to your `server.cfg`
4. Open a console on the project folder and run `yarn` to install dependencies  
    4.1. The resource needs to be built with `yarn build`  
    4.2. You can also use `yarn start:dev` to build and start the server
